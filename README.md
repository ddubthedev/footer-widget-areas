#Footer Widget Areas

This is the README for my short function to add widgets to the footer of a WordPress theme. 

There are two files included in this repo:

1. functions.php - contains code to copy to your theme's functions.php files
2. footer.php - footer.php file to include in your WordPress theme, or to use a reference in your theme.
